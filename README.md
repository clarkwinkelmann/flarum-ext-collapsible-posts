This extension allows collapsing some posts, so they don't clutter the discussion, while still keeping them accessible.

This is published mostly as a **proof of concept**, there are still probably multiple ways this can break.

At the moment all posts are collapsed as "off-topic", but the extension is designed to add more reasons in the future.

I might add more features during future live streams.

## Installation

The extension is not on Packagist at this time.

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
